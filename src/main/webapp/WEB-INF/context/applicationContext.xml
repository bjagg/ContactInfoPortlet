                 | The following optional files allow deployers to set or override most
                 | configuration settings in a manner that is outside the footprint of the
                 | build/deploy cycle and SCM.
                 |
                 | Reasons for choosing that may include:
                 |   - Desire to keep sensitive information out of your Git repository
                 |   - Ability to change some common settings without a full build and deploy cycle
                 |   - Building a WAR/EAR that is environment-independent
                 |
                 | Any property defined in the above files that is referenced in the Spring context
                 | may be overridden in one (or both) of these files.  Later files override earlier
                 | files.
                 |
                 | The conventional location of ${portal.home} is ${catalina.base}/portal;  but you
                 | can (typically) override that location using a PORTAL_HOME environment variable.
                 | (Ultimately it depends on your setenv.sh or setenv.bat file.)
                 |
                 | The first file (global.properties) may contain properties that are shared with
                 | other modules (e.g. portlets) in Tomcat.  Several Apereo portlets source
                 | global.properties automatically.  The second file (announcements.properties) is
                 | (should be) sourced by this module exclusively.
